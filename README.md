# USB-UART dongle

---

Name: <!-- TODO: place nam here -->

---

An USB to UART/Serial dongle. This is handy to communicate or program your microcontroller or sensor projects. The dongle provides status leds that show RX and TX activity. It also has a power led and an internal 3V3 power converter.

Features:

- [ ] All components should be SMD, except for pinheaders and connectors
  - [ ] Use 0805 for resistors and capacitors ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology#Packages))
  - [ ] Pinheaders are male 2.54 mm (0.1 inch) pitched ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_header))
- [ ] The USB connector is of the USB-C type. Many variations exist. Choose the one with the `HRO_TYPE-C-31-M-12` footprint. This connector type has less pins and is hand solderable.
- [ ] To protect the USB devices against ESD, a protection circuit is recommended. The `USBLC6-2SC6` is a cheap and good solution.
- [ ] The resistor values for the leds need te be calculated depending on the leds you choose (eg: 20mA, 5mA, ...)
